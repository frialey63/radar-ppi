Radar PPI

## Background

This is a JavaFX application to emulate an 'olde' radar PPI display.

## Modes

It operates in one of two modes:

- simulation of tracks or
- request of tracks from the ADS-B data source provided by the companion project dump1090-processor available in my GitHub repo

## Controls

There are basic keyboard controls:

- 'a' will cycle through annotation style on the range and bearing reticle
- '1'..'5' will select a maximum range for the reticle
